Hello,
<br> <br> My name is Suvajra Kamble. I have done a Bsc in Computer Science from Mumbai University.
I was more interested in Music and event so I pursued my career in the event industry. 
<br> <br>I have 4 years of experience working as a general manager for music based event company. <br> <br> I have come across this amazing blockchain technology, so I have started learning and gaining knowledge about blockchain development. I am fresher in this industry and would like to explore more opportunities.
<br> <br>Looking forward to having conversations with you.
